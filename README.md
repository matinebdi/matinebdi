# Hi, I’m @matinebdi

## Who am I?

I’m a Master’s student at ESILV and an **AI Engineer & Software Engineer apprentice at Dassault Systèmes (ENOVIA)**, where I develop AI-driven solutions for industrial Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) and product portfolio optimization systems.

I design and build **agentic AI systems** and scalable intelligent architectures for real-world enterprise environments. My work focuses on structured reasoning systems, multi-agent orchestration, and production-grade AI engineering.

I specialize in building systems where LLMs don’t just generate text — they reason, call tools, communicate with other agents, and operate within controlled, reliable, and production-ready architectures.

## What I work on

- Multi-agent orchestration systems  
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool ecosystems  
- A2A (Agent-to-Agent) communication architectures  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines  
- Structured tool calling & controlled LLM workflows  
- AI backend systems for enterprise environments
