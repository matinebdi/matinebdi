 Hi, Iâ€™m @matinebdi
     Who am I?
Iâ€™m a data scientist in training, currently pursuing a Master of Science at ESILV.
Iâ€™m passionate about transforming complex data into actionable insights and building intelligent, interactive dashboards.
I work mainly with Python, SQL, and Power BI to uncover patterns and drive data-driven decisions.

   What Iâ€™m working on?
Iâ€™m currently deepening my skills in machine learning, advanced Python programming, and Streamlit for deploying data science applications.

   What Iâ€™m learning right now:

Machine learning and deep learning techniques for predictive modeling.

Generative AI applications and building intelligent agents.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for enhancing AI systems with external knowledge.

Advanced data visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib.

Interactive app development with Streamlit to deploy data-driven solutions.

   What Iâ€™m looking for:

Internship or apprenticeship opportunities in Data Science, Data Engineering, or Artificial Intelligence, starting oct 2025.

Collaboration on data-driven projects involving Python, SQL, machine learning, or visualization tools.

ðŸ“« How to reach me:
Feel free to connect with me here on GitHub or via email. Iâ€™m open to discussing data science projects, internships, and new collaboration opportunities.

âš¡ Fun fact:
When Iâ€™m not analyzing datasets or building models, youâ€™ll find me solving coding challenges or designing creative dashboards!
